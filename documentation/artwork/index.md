# AI Artwork

Used huggingface.co models directly as I'm cheap as hell. I know there are ethical concerns but if I'm being honest, I didn't know what I would even want to comission if I had the money. AI is doing the part of "idea generator" for me here.
If this takes off, it'll be worth a commission to create a proper logo and/or "mascot".

This was all generated over the course of a day using my phone while doing things around the house. There were a lot of "misses" that I still saved because everything felt like a masterpeice I wouldn't see again.
