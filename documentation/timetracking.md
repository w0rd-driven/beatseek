# Time Tracking

Just for personal edification, I like tracking the time spent on this but it'll be extremely fuzzy.
I perhaps spent conscious and unconscious months coming up with the idea of simply replicating the iTunes "here is a new album of the band in your collection" as its own MVP.
The Livebooks started as prototype covering multiple days of only a couple of hours but over the course of weeks. It's Wednesday, January 11 and the demo day is slated for January 20 from 12:30 to 3:00 pm and I've essentially just completed the prototyping in Livebook.

## Days

### January 11

3:30 pm - 5:15 pm

* 15 min - Ran `mix phx.new` and overwrote the generated files. This was the quickest framework upgrade I've ever done but nothing was generated.
* 30 min - Updated ID3 Livebook with capturing the other TYER frame as well as the picture. I'm not quite sure what I'll do with the picture as I believe the binary is stored here. I likely don't want that in the database.

### January 12

2:00 am - 2:45 am

* 30 min - Research and generated authentication screens. Investigated changes and workflows to get an understanding of what gets added.
* 15 min - Diary and time tracking.

* 1 hour? - Specification started to Data Layer. This started during the day sometime though I did go to bed at 4 am yesterday
* 30 min - Further Spotify prototyping to verify data layer

### January 13

11:15 am - 1:45 am?

* 1 min - Research Tailwind UI sidebar components and Figma
* 1.5 hour - Specification v0.1 completed

I haven't done a timesheet in so damn long I've already had problems keeping track. These hours could be wildly over or under though I for sure didn't spend 8 hours so far. I played Axiom Verge 2 instead of worked on this after class so I know I didn't do much then.
