# Time Tracking

Just for personal edification, I like tracking the time spent on this but it'll be extremely fuzzy.
I perhaps spent conscious and unconscious months coming up with the idea of simply replicating the iTunes "here is a new album of the band in your collection" as its own MVP.
The Livebooks started as prototype covering multiple days of only a couple of hours but over the course of weeks. It's Wednesday, January 11 and the demo day is slated for January 20 from 12:30 to 3:00 pm and I've essentially just completed the prototyping in Livebook.

## Days

### January 11

3:30 pm - 5:15 pm

* 15 min - Ran `mix phx.new` and overwrote the generated files. This was the quickest framework upgrade I've ever done but nothing was generated.
* 30 min - Updated ID3 Livebook with capturing the other TYER frame as well as the picture. I'm not quite sure what I'll do with the picture as I believe the binary is stored here. I likely don't want that in the database.
