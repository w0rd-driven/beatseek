# Sunday, January 15

It's technically early again as I had a family day and slept until almost 2 am. It's now 4 and I'm importing the AI artwork generated and looking to Livebeats for heavy inspiration.
I know I want a sidebar with similar navigation made to look close to iTunes as possible to save time. I'm really under the gun here and I haven't even moved to the API part yet. I do think that'll go pretty smoothly and if I work PubSub right, it'll all just work(tm) if I have the components in place.
