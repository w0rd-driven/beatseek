# Tuesday, January 17

I'm writing this at midnight on Wednesday/Thursday so that's how well I'm keeping up with this and time tracking, eh.
I spent the bulk of the time writing up a list of what was left, creating a private repo and issues to match everything but the Next: section.
As of Thursday, I didn't do the greatest job separating issues because I've been working but few things were marked 100% completion.
As always, I tend to be pushing paint around a canvas until things start to look decent. I also didn't fall asleep like I have been lately.
I spent a bit on the couch, which is starting to eat away at my productivity after doing this for so long. 2 days away from that habit wasn't enough.
